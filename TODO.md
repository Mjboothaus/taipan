- Get basic sidebars setup - Done - need to do for all pages
- Set up Streamlit debug - Done
- Report deploy time in justfile - DONE - to test - seems OK
- Exclude dirs from tree listing (do only dir & not subdirs)
- Set up pytest-ing and write some (generic tests - of setup?)
- Maybe replace dirtree.py with seedir package - DONE - test & refine
